# rs-rivine - Rivine Rust client

This repository contains a Rust implementation of the Rivine client, daemon and common libraries. It is based on the (Golang) reference implementation which can be found on [github.com/rivine/rivine](http://github.com/rivine/rivine).

## Warning

rs-rivine is alpha quality. It may break things and could have security vulnerabilities. Use at your own risk.

For now rs-rivine should still be considered an expiremental playground, rather than an actual alternative Rivine client.

rs-rivine is not functional yet and cannot even connect to testnet.

Should you wish to use rivine for any serious applications, I kindly refer you to the Reference (Golang) implementation at [github.com/rivine/rivine](http://github.com/rivine/rivine), which is functional and does connect to testnet.
